# Video to Audio Converter

This is a Node.js application that uses FFmpeg and the fluent-ffmpeg library to convert video files to audio.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* You have installed [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
* FFmpeg is added to the system PATH.

### Installing FFmpeg on Windows

1. Download FFmpeg from the [official site](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Choose the link that matches your system architecture (32 or 64 bit).
2. Extract the downloaded file. You will get a folder, which includes three sub-folders (bin, doc, presets).
3. Add FFmpeg to Windows PATH:
    * Right-click on Computer and choose Properties.
    * Choose Advanced system settings.
    * In the System Properties window, choose Environment Variables.
    * In the Environment Variables window, you will see a list of User variables and System variables. Under System variables, find and select the variable named Path, then click on Edit.
    * In the Edit Environment Variable window, move the cursor to the end of the Variable value line, add a semicolon (;) and then add the path to the 'bin' directory in the FFmpeg folder you downloaded earlier. For example, if you extracted FFmpeg to `C:\FFmpeg`, you would add `C:\FFmpeg\bin`.
    * Click OK to close each window.

### Installing FFmpeg on Linux (Ubuntu)
